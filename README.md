# Basic React setup (from new)
a basic querystring router in reactJS

`$ mkdir projectName && cd projectName`

`$ npm init`

`$ npm i react react-dom react-router --save`

`$ npm install webpack webpack-dev-server babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react --save-dev`

`$ touch .babelrc webpack.config.js`

`$ mkdir src/ && cd src/ && touch index.html App.js main.js && cd -`

`$ npm start`

# Basic React setup (from cloning this)

since the .gitignore has node_modules you will have to get them using the recipes found in `package.json` by running `$ npm install`, thats it

# Now onto the querystring

Once this is all running go ahead and try the `http://localhost:3333/#/?message=rick rock` your browser will interpret the spaces so don't worry (that much)
